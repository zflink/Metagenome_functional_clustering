# Instructions
If you would like to run the Jupyter python notebooks in the main directory, download and unzip the datafiles from this [figshare project](https://figshare.com/projects/Metagenome_functional_clustering/187989) into this directory.

The "download.zip" files contain taxonomic composition tables from JGI. Once unzipped, the "Taxonomy_analysis.ipynb" will read them.
